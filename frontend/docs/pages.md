## User Pages

For routing to differnt pages for users including existing users and new users, the pages are divided into.
``` cs
src/
 └── pages/
       ├── Favorite/
       ├── Home/
       ├── Movie-Details/
       ├── Movies/
       ├── My-Bookings/
       ├── Seat-Layout/
       └── Admin/
            ├── Dashboard
            ├── Add-Shows
            ├── List-Bookings
            └── List-Shows
       
       
```

Now, each page can have any numbers of components as required.
